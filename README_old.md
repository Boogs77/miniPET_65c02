# miniPET: 65C02-Based Retro Computer

![Main Photo](gallery/miniPET_image1.png)

The **Boogs77-miniPET** is a compact, high-performance 8-bit computer inspired by the iconic Commodore PET aesthetics. Built around the **W65C02S** processor, this project utilizes the modular architecture of the [BO6502 System](https://github.com/Boogs77/BO6502_65C02-based_modular_computer) and integrates it into a custom-designed, 3D-printed enclosure.

## 🧠 System Architecture & Modules

The internal logic of the miniPET is derived directly from the modular boards of the BO6502 project. Each core component follows the same electrical and logical specifications:

### ⚙️ Core Processing Unit (CPU, RAM, ROM)
The system's "brain" and memory management are based on the high-reliability design of the BO6502:
* **CPU:** Western Design Center **W65C02S**, allowing for modern high-speed operation while maintaining full 6502 compatibility. Reference: [BO6502 CPU](https://github.com/Boogs77/BO6502_65C02-based_modular_computer/tree/main/BO6502%20CPU).
* **Clock:** System operates with a stable **1MHz** clock frequency. Reference: [BO6502 CPU](https://github.com/Boogs77/BO6502_65C02-based_modular_computer/tree/main/BO6502%20CPU).

### 🗺️ Memory Map
The memory layout is organized to ensure compatibility with the system firmware and modular hardware:
* **RAM (32KB):** Mapped from **$0000** to **$7FFF**. Reference: [BO6502 RAM](https://github.com/Boogs77/BO6502_65C02-based_modular_computer/tree/main/BO6502%20RAM).
* **ROM (32KB):** Mapped from **$8000** to **$FFFF**. Reference: [BO6502 ROM](https://github.com/Boogs77/BO6502_65C02-based_modular_computer/tree/main/BO6502%20ROM).

### 📟 Display Interface (BIGLCD)
The visual output is handled by the **BIGLCD** module. 
* **Addressing:** The module is mapped and accessible at memory address **$D19X**.
* **Reference:** [BO6502 BIGLCD](https://github.com/Boogs77/BO6502_65C02-based_modular_computer/tree/main/BO6502%20BIGLCD).

### ⌨️ Keyboard Input
Input is managed via a dedicated matrix keyboard interface.
* **Addressing:** The keyboard is mapped and accessible at memory address **$D18X**.
* **Reference:** [BO6502 KeyBoard Module](https://github.com/Boogs77/BO6502_65C02-based_modular_computer/tree/main/BO6502%20KEYb).

### 🔌 Serial Communication
Asynchronous communication is provided for external terminal access.
* **Addressing:** Accessible at the **$CXXX** memory range.
* **Reference:** [BO6502 Serial Module](https://github.com/Boogs77/BO6502_65C02-based_modular_computer/tree/main/BO6502%20SERIAL).

## 💻 Software & Firmware

The Boogs77-miniPET features a classic software environment for 6502 enthusiasts:
* **System Monitor:** The computer implements the legendary **Wozmon** monitor, providing a low-level interface for memory inspection and machine code execution.
* **Microsoft BASIC:** The firmware includes **MS BASIC**, allowing for high-level programming.
* **Execution:** BASIC can be launched directly from the monitor by executing from location **$8000**.

## 🏗️ Enclosure & 3D Design

One of the most distinctive features of this project is its custom case, modified using **Autodesk Fusion 360** from the original design at [commodorepetmini.com](https://commodorepetmini.com/). The case was printed on an **Anycubic Kobra S1**.
